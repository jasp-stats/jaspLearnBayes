"This analysis demonstrates <b>binary classification</b> which is a common "
"statistical procedure where subjects are classified into two groups based on "
"a classification rule.\n"
"\n"
"                   Binary classification is a procedure where data about the "
"subject is dichotomised to reach a binary decision (e.g., yes/no, true/"
"false).\n"
"\n"
"                   Common binary classification applications are:\n"
"                   <ul>\n"
"                     <li><b>Medical testing and diagnosis</b> where the "
"classification determines whether a patient suffers from a certain disease "
"or not.</li>\n"
"                     <li><b>Spam detection</b> where the classification "
"determines whether a message (e.g., an email) is a spam or not.</li>\n"
"                     <li><b>Quality control</b> where the classification "
"determines whether an industry standard has been met or not.</li>\n"
"                   </ul>\n"
"\n"
"                   Due to the fact that binary classification is often used "
"in medical testing, terminology in binary classification problems borrows "
"from medical dictionary (e.g., prevalence, condition, marker).\n"
"\n"
"                   In practice, there is an important distinction between "
"the <i>true</i> state of the subject and the <i>assigned label</i> given by "
"the classification rule. In JASP, the true state is called <b>condition</b> "
"(positive/negative) and the assigned label is called <b>test</b> (positive/"
"negative). In many applications, the conditions or the test may not be "
"symmetric, therefore various types of errors are of interest in addition to "
"an overall accuracy measure. These types of errors distinguish, for example, "
"whether a patient suffers from a condition but the test came out negative "
"(false negative), or whether a patient does not suffer from a condition but "
"the test came out positive (false positive).\n"
"\n"
"                   Properties of the test are usually described in terms of "
"its <b>sensitivity</b> and <b>specificity</b>. Sensitivity is the "
"probability of testing positive if the condition is positive. Specificity is "
"the probability of testing negative if the condition is negative. Property "
"of condition is <b>prevalence</b>, which is the proportion of subjects that "
"have a positive condition in the population.\n"
"                   Skewed characteristics of the test or prevalence can lead "
"to situations that may appear to the untrained eye as paradoxical. For "
"example, in certain situations it is more likely that a patient does not "
"have a certain disease than does, even after testing positive for that "
"disease.\n"
"\n"
"                   Formally, the probability that a subject has a positive "
"condition after the test came out positive (i.e., positive predictive value) "
"is obtained by applying the <b>Bayes theorem</b>:\n"
